- fuzzy matching. some quickly computed metric of similarity of build.

- harder: given a replay and a player, find a replay with the most similar build
- snapshots of 2:30, 3:00, 3:30, 4:00, etc.
- if you give a specific time then it's a lot easier.

note: for zerg, maybe you look at the buildings to determine what the build is.
one idea: when the first units die. But sometimes there's a small firefight before the build is done. e.g., terran infantry timing attacks.
